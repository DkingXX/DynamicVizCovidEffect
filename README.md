## About

Covid-19 was found in Wuhan last year. It has caused a global pandemic for more than one year. 
Transmission of this virus occurred mostly in close contact with another person. Researchers from
TU Delft developed a model that analyzes the spreading of Covid-19 with temporal networks. 
To help researchers and society better understand this model, we decide to visualize it. 
With the animation, we can help the society understand the importance of quarantine in the real life.

## Introduction

Human contact networks facilitate the spreading of Epidemic and information. 
Contact networks such as face-to-face contact networks are temporal networks, networks
that evolve over time. In temporal networks, the activity (connected or not, 
having a contact or not) of a link between two nodes might change over time. This
is in contrast to static networks where the connection of each link is static. 
Epidemic/information spreading can be mitigated by blocking physical contacts.
Covid-19 measures like curfew, working at home, social distancing all aim to prevent
physical contacts. These measures treat at least a subgroup of the population
in the same way. In this project, we address the further question on how to mitigate
the epidemic spreading more effectively via selecting the contacts to block 
heterogeneously and strategically. We propose to develop contact removal strategies
utilizing the temporal network properties of contacts.


## Server
- The server is created with [FastApi](!https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi).
- Detailed Documentation and usage should visit [Server Documentation](./server/README.md).

## Client
- The client is created with [Vue](!https://github.com/vuejs/vue).
- Detailed Documentation and usage should visit [Client Documentation](./client/README.md).


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by TU Delft AI Lab.
