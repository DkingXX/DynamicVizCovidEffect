What's the replacement for the numpy? Are we going to create our own functions or we have to find similar package since we have one which is numjs, however it provides limited functionality.


Project plan is sufficient or not? What's the suggestions for the project plan?

Dataset converting problem, we have 3 different dataset in our folder, but it has .mit .dat .csv file, however the "panda" in js only has capacity for csv file, how we going to solve this problem with js? Are we going to limit the input file to csv?
