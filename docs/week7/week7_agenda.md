# Questions for the TA
* How to make CI work: The CI is working during the midnight only
* We need a cluster to run the simulation. How can we approach this issue?
* How will we be graded for the final presentation? 
  (relationship between the commits, and questions asked during presentation).
  + Sprint review.

# Question round
Are there any questions?

# Meeting Notes
* Discussions on making CI work
  + The CI might work if it allows us to upload two docker images, but current GitLab server only allows one.
  + We still should have a talk with the client, since she might have funding for hardware supported.
  + If the client cannot provide hardware resources, the requirements regarding the CI can be discarded and will not be taken into consideration during grading.
  

* Discussions on final presentation
  + It will be fine for Q&A round if every team member is able to answer the question(s) regarding his/her expertise.
  

* Discussions on commits
  + It is a serious issue at the moment within the team, so we have to find a way to balance the workload. Members who have done a lot could help others with their tasks.
