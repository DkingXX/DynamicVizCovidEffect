# Week plan 5

## Last week
* Create a friendly GUI that allows the user compare the results of each individual simulation.

* Start working on the data visualisation (+ creating a DEMO) regarding the simulation.

* Analyze the algorithm in order to speed the computation time



## This week
* Discuss the design of the web application and implement new DEMOS.
* Merge both GUI and data visualization together.
* Implement a new View that allows a user to see and change the data in-depth.
* Port the simulations to a database (? still to be discussed).
* Create a backend that will provide the simulation data.
