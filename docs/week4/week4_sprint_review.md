# Sprint review 4

| User Story | Task     | Assigned to | Expected duration (hours) | Actual duration (hours) | Done  | Notes |
| :--------- | :------- | :---------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------- | :---- | :---- |
|Create an interface that allows the user to see multiple simulations in the same time.|A new view that allows every individual to choose how data is simulated.|Andrei & Ina|15|16|Yes|The simulation data is stored in a state class that preserves the states on every view.|
|Based on the previous user story create the necessary components (paramChooser/navBar..etc).|Andrei & Ina|8|8|Yes|N/A|
|Users should be able to view the network at a specific timestamp.|Make a timeline that can be scrolled & make the timestamp that can be selected.|Xiangyu & Zenan|2|2|No|We haven't figured out how to do that since our design at the moment doesn't allow to extract the data at a specific timestamp. So we have to re-construct our code.|
|Users must be able to start/stop/go to the network in next/previous timestamp/reset the network in advanced view.|Merge the function of each button to corresponding button in advanced view.|Xiangyu & Zenan|1|2|No|Since the GUI was designed by other team members but this task was assigned to different members, it takes some time to get to know each others' idea.|

## Improvements from last sprint

* We communicated more effectively as a team, asking for help if we are stuck with some issues.
* We added due dates for each issue.
