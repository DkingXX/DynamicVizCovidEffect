---

Date:           10/05/2021\
Main focus:     Discussing the current state\
Chair:          Andrei\
Note taker:     Ina

Notes: N/A

# Opening
Present: Ina, Zenan, Andrei, Xiangyu, Ziang, Alves and Marco\
Absent: None

# Points of action

* Create a friendly GUI (Done)
* Create a demo for data visualisation (Done)
* Learn vue and get friendly with vue (Done)
* Analyze the algorithm in order to speed the computation time (Done)

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
* Discuss the design of the web application and implement new DEMOS.
* Merge both GUI and data visualization together.
* Implement a new View that allows a user to see and change the data in-depth.
* Port the simulations to a database (? still to be discussed).
* Create a backend that will provide the simulation data.

# Any other business
* If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
* Suggestions on speeding up the simulation for both TA and coach.
* File size is too big for delivering it directly to the user. Should we use a database? If yes we have to see if it is reliable.
* Ask about what can be improved on the DEMOS.
* Suggestions on what we have showed.
* + Sprint review.

# Question round
Are there any questions?

# Meeting Note
* Shared folder that also contains the meeting notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_qHbaDlNj6lj1LJKYNCvMwrZIq8jWbTtC727h5m-siI/edit
* Dividing issues - implement parameters for simulation, add/reset buttons, etc => more details in the board
* Add more tasks and subtasks in the sprint plan
* Remove parts from the example agenda if not needed

#Questions and answers
* Q: Speeding up the simulation\
A: provide TU Delft hosted server; AWS => get some cloud computing service (needs to be agreed by client)
**(In the meantime, we figured out a way to compute the simulation in a decent amount of time)**

* Q: File size is too big\
A: Data can be sent compressed => it can take the load of network traffic
**(In the meantime, we tested a few ways to compress the data and at the moment the file size is no longer an issue)**
