Notes:
Our client huijuan is on vacation for this week, so we won't schedule a meeting with her for this week.

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
* finish the project plan

* Get to know what the dataset means

* Get to know what the algorithm does

* Learn vue and get friendly with vue


# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*
Discuss rubrics.
Discuss the project plan
Discuss about the tests

# Question round
Are there any questions?

Notes:

How to test?

    Use node js test functions, test the output of the algorithm

# Meeting Note
* Understand the algorithm & meaning of the dataset given (talk with the client). For example, we have to figure out what is the input and output of the system. 
* Finalise the project plan. For instance, the requirements need to be optimally defined and find out what is data structure in our case. 
Whether or not to include testing depends on our implementation on the backend.
* Project approach vs Development Methodology (more into detail about the approach + planning + strategies). Approach is what we do and methodology is how we do it. 
* Although backlog & retrospective are not in rubric, they are still recommended to be uploaded to Gitlab for grading purposes. 

# Closing
Thank you for coming.
