# Week plan 9

## Last week

* Fixed and Improve the layout design of Navigation Buttons and Timeline #50
* Fixed State Data sharing between simulations (BUG) #72
* Fixed the CI
* Backend Tests (sim request tests)
* Simulation Speed Adjustments #36
* New Requirement which shows comparison statistics between two simulations
* Loading Screen that allows the user to see that the client waits for data from the backend #68
* Improved the backend speed #73

## This week
* Meet with the client to talk about the progress we make on the new requirements.
* Finish the report
* Fix the bug about the simulation not displaying with other datasets besides hs11 (the datasets are not indexed from 0)
* Fix some backend tests
* Run static analysis on the server (branch coverage, maintainability index, cyclomatic index)

## Improvement
* We made more commits & merge requests by splitting tasks into atomic units.

## Problems Encountered (to be updated during the week if any problem encountered)
* Frontend tests are difficult to write as it is always not necessary to.
