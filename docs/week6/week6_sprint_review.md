## Improvements from last sprint

* We distributed our tasks in a more balanced way regarding the workload.
* We asked for more help from other team members when encountering problems that cannot be solved by ourselves. 
* We made more commits & merge requests by splitting tasks into atomic units.
* We made improvements on using the issue board.
