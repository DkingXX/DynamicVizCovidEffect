# Week plan 6

## Last week
* Integrate data visualization into GUI.
* Implement a new View that allows users to see and change the data in-depth.
* Make use of the API to run the algorithm efficiently, compress & decompress the output.

## This week
* Discuss with the client and try to make CI work.
* Improve the GUI on making a timeline that contains a point for users to scroll to certain timestamp and view the network at that specific timestamp. Also simplify the network by removing/adding connection(s) from previous/next timestamp.
* Implement a network visualization feature that a random seed node will be selected at the beginning of the network evolvement and show how it affects the whole network along the timeline.
* Prepare for midterm presentation.


## Improvements
The improvements and issues can be seen in the sprint review associated with this week 6 plan.

## Problems Encountered (to be updated during the week if any problem was encountered)
* Cannot make the CI work because we are not able to upload docker image to TU Delft Gitlab.
